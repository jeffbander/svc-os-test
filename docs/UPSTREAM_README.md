## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Clerk account for authentication and billing
- Convex account for database

### Quick Install (Recommended)

If you have [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) installed, run the `/install` command for a guided, automated setup:

```bash
claude
# Then type: /install
```

This will:
- Create a Clerk application automatically (no account needed upfront)
- Generate all required secrets
- Configure `.env.local` with all environment variables
- Set up Convex project interactively
- Create the webhook endpoint
- Set Convex environment variables

You'll receive a claim URL to create your Clerk account after setup completes.

After installation, your app runs locally at the provided URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`). Develop and customize your app here — no deployment is needed until you're ready to share it with others.

### Quick Deploy to Dev (`/deploy-to-dev`)

When you're ready for others to see your app, deploy to Vercel with a single command. This uses your existing Clerk and Convex **development** instances — the same ones you see locally:

```bash
claude
# Then type: /deploy-to-dev
```

This is **fully automated** — no manual steps required (assuming `gh` and `npx vercel` are already authenticated). It uses your existing Clerk dev keys and Convex dev instance.

**What gets automated:**
- Private GitHub repo creation + remote reconfiguration
- Vercel project linking
- All environment variables set on Vercel (read from `.env.local`)
- Production deployment to Vercel

**Prerequisites:** `gh auth login` and `npx vercel login` must be done once beforehand. The command checks and tells you if either is missing.

Your app will be fully functional on Vercel with a small Clerk development badge. After the initial deployment, updating your site is just `git push origin main` — Vercel automatically rebuilds on every push.

### Deploy to Production (`/deploy-to-prod`)

When you want to collect real credit cards, remove the Clerk dev badge, and have users depend on your app, run the production deployment. **Delay this step** until you've validated your site and are confident you want to finalize it — it requires a Stripe account, a custom domain, and several manual configuration steps:

```bash
claude
# Then type: /deploy-to-prod
```

**Prerequisites (must have before running):**
- A custom domain you own (e.g., `myapp.com`) — Clerk production requires this, `*.vercel.app` is not accepted
- A Stripe account — for Clerk Billing integration
- Google OAuth credentials (optional) — for Google social login

| Manual Step | Where | Time |
|-------------|-------|------|
| Create Clerk production instance | Clerk Dashboard (with your custom domain) | ~1 min |
| Copy & paste 2 Clerk production keys | Clerk Dashboard → API Keys | ~30 sec |
| Connect Stripe to Clerk | Clerk Dashboard → Billing | ~2 min |
| Google OAuth setup (optional) | Google Cloud Console + Clerk Dashboard | ~5-10 min |

**What gets automated:**
- GitHub repo creation (if not already done)
- Clerk production key validation + JWT template creation
- Frontend API URL derivation from production publishable key
- Convex production deploy key generation
- Convex function deployment to production
- Production webhook creation via Svix
- All Convex and Vercel production env vars
- `vercel.json` with Convex build command
- Production deployment to Vercel

Alternatively, run the setup script directly:

```bash
npm install
node scripts/setup.mjs init --site-name="My App" --admin-email="you@example.com"
node scripts/setup.mjs convex-setup --project-name="My App"
node scripts/setup.mjs configure --clerk-sk="sk_test_..." --admin-email="you@example.com"
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download and set up the starter template:

```bash
# Download the template files to your project directory
# Then navigate to your project directory and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/harperaa/secure-vibe-coding-OS.git [project-name]
cd [project-name]
npm install #or pnpm / yarn / bun
```

2. Set up your environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Configure your environment variables (complete each step/setting in order in the `.env.local` file ):

```bash
# a. Site Branding (Name your site)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=YOUR SITE NAME HERE

# b. Clerk Authentication & Billing
# Sign up and get these from your Clerk dashboard at https://dashboard.clerk.com
# Select "Create application", Name it, hit "Create application"
# Then on Overview page > scroll down to "2. Set your Clerk API keys" > copy/paste here.
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_clerk_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_clerk_secret_key_here

# c. Setup your JWT template Clerk Frontend API URL in Clerk 
# Dashboard > Configure > JWT Templates > Add new template > select convex from Template dropdown > save
# Copy the URL from the issuer field and paste it here, ensure it ends with .dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=https://your-clerk-frontend-api-url.clerk.accounts.dev

# d. Convex Configuration
# Sign up and get these from your Convex dashboard at https://dashboard.convex.dev
# Create new project, then goto Settings > Project Settings > Lost Access
# Copy/paste/execute command: npx convex dev --configure=existing --team your_team_name --project your_project_name
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_convex_deployment_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-convex-url.convex.cloud

# e. confirm the above values are updated automatically in .env.local by the convex script.  

# f. Set the Convex Environment variable for NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL
# Click link in terminal from running convex config, to set the NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL there.
# Use value from above for NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL

# g. CSRF Protection
# Generate these secrets using: node -p "require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url')"
CSRF_SECRET=<32-byte-base64url-string>
SESSION_SECRET=<32-byte-base64url-string>

# Clerk Redirect URLs (leave these for now)
# These ensure users are redirected to dashboard after authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
```

4. Terminate and Re-Initialize Convex (leave it running in the background):
```bash
npx convex dev
```

5. Convex Webhook Secret
- Get the site url from your Convex dashboard at https://dashboard.convex.dev
- Select your new project
- > Settings > URL & Deploy Key > Show development credentials > HTTP Actions URL (copy that URL)
- Goto Clerk dashboard > Configure > Webhooks > Add Endpoint > Paste in the above Convex HTTP Actions URL and append endpoint
- ex. {HTTP Actions URL}/clerk-users-webhook
- Search for and enable the following events: 
- Enable events: `user.created`, `user.updated`, `user.deleted`, `paymentAttempt.updated`
- Copy the webhook signing secret to your Convex environment variables
- Note: CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET should be set in your Convex dashboard environment variables (not here)

6. Set up Convex environment variables in your Convex dashboard:

```bash
# In Convex Dashboard Environment Variables
CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=https://your-clerk-frontend-api-url.clerk.accounts.dev
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@example.com
```

**Note:** The `ADMIN_EMAIL` must match the email address you use to sign up/sign in. Only this user will see the "Administration" section in the sidebar and have access to the Security Monitoring dashboard. If `ADMIN_EMAIL` is not configured, the app will throw an error when accessing admin features.

7. Setup Clerk Subscriptons (Required for template to work)
- Clerk dashboard > Subscriptions > Create a Plan > Add User Plan > Name the plan > Set the Monthly base fee 
- Hit Save button  
- Hit Enable Billing button at top of screen (very important)


### Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🔀 Git Workflow Commands

Secure Vibe Coding OS ships with 11 slash commands that cover the full development lifecycle. Run them from Claude Code (`claude` in your terminal).

```
/create-feature-branch [purpose]   Start new work from latest main
/commit                            Stage all and commit with strong message
/push                              Push branch to GitHub
/merge-to-testing                  Add feature branch to testing environment
/create-pull-request               Sync with main, open PR via GitHub CLI
/stash-push                        Temporarily save uncommitted changes
/stash-pop                         Restore most recently stashed changes
/sync-feature-branch               Rebase feature branch on latest main
/sync-testing-branch               Merge main into testing (safe for shared branch)
/status                            Plain-English summary of current state
/security-assessment               Run comprehensive security assessment via agents
```

### Everyday Workflow

```
/create-feature-branch user-login     ← start
  ... write code ...
/commit                               ← save
/push                                 ← sync to GitHub, get preview URL
  ... test on preview URL ...
/security-assessment                  ← assess before PR
/create-pull-request                  ← open PR for review
```

Every push and PR automatically runs the CI pipeline (lint → test → security → build) defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. All four jobs must pass before merging to `main`.

For a detailed guide on branch strategy, commit conventions, CI/CD pipeline design, and deployment environments, see [`docs/git_cicd_workflow_guide.pdf`](docs/git_cicd_workflow_guide.pdf).

## 🧠 Continual Learning System

Secure Vibe Coding OS includes a unique **self-improving learning system** that gets smarter over time as you use it.

### How It Works

The system maintains a dynamic lessons library that captures your real-world experiences:

```
.claude/skills/lessons/
├── implementing-rate-limiting/
│   └── SKILL.md          # What worked, what failed, exact parameters
├── fixing-csrf-validation/
│   └── SKILL.md          # Debugging steps, root causes, solutions
├── optimizing-convex-queries/
│   └── SKILL.md          # Performance learnings, query patterns
└── [your-future-lessons]/
    └── SKILL.md          # Grows with every session
```

### The Learning Loop

**1. Before Starting Work** - Learn from the past
```bash
/advise

# Describe your goal:
> "I need to implement rate limiting on my API endpoints"

# Claude searches past lessons and finds:
# ✅ What worked: withRateLimit HOF pattern
# ❌ What failed: Redis approach (too complex)
# 🔧 Exact params: 5 req/min, IP-based tracking
# 💡 Key insight: Use Map for simple cases
```

**2. During Work** - Apply proven solutions
- Use exact parameters that worked before
- Avoid documented pitfalls from "Failed Attempts" tables
- Build on previous successes instead of starting from scratch

**3. After Completing Work** - Capture your learnings
```bash
/retrospective

# Claude analyzes your session and creates:
# - Detailed documentation of what you accomplished
# - What worked vs. what failed
# - Exact parameters and configurations
# - Lessons learned for next time
# - Creates a PR with your learnings
```

### Why This Matters

**Traditional Development**: Every task starts from zero, same mistakes repeated
```
Task 1: Try A, B, C → C works
Task 2: Try A, B, C → C works again (wasted effort)
Task 3: Try A, B, C → C works again (still wasting time)
```

**With Continual Learning**: Each task makes future tasks faster
```
Task 1: Try A, B, C → C works → Document in lessons
Task 2: Read lesson → Start with C → Success immediately
Task 3: Read lesson → Start with C → Success immediately
```

### Benefits Over Time

**Week 1**: Empty lessons folder, learning as you go
- Complete first API endpoint (took 2 hours, tried 3 approaches)
- Run `/retrospective` to capture learnings

**Week 2**: Start building lessons library
- Need second API endpoint
- Run `/advise` - finds lesson from Week 1
- Complete in 30 minutes using proven pattern

**Week 4**: Lessons compound
- 5+ documented lessons from various tasks
- Most new work has relevant past experience
- Development speed increases 3-5x on similar tasks
- Team members learn from your documented experiences

**Month 3**: Institutional knowledge base
- 20+ real-world lessons from actual production work
- Exact parameters for common tasks
- Documented pitfalls and how to avoid them
- New team members onboard faster by reading lessons

### Example Lessons

**lessons/implementing-rate-limiting/SKILL.md**:
```markdown
## Failed Attempts ❌
| Attempt | What We Tried | Why It Failed | Lesson Learned |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | Redis-based rate limiter | Too complex for use case | Start simple, add complexity only if needed |
| 2 | Cookie-based tracking | Easily bypassed | Use IP-based for public endpoints |

## What Worked ✅
- withRateLimit HOF with Map-based tracking
- Parameters: limitWindow: 60000, maxRequests: 5
- IP extraction from x-forwarded-for header
```

**lessons/debugging-clerk-webhooks/SKILL.md**:
```markdown
## Root Cause
Webhook secret was set in .env.local instead of Convex dashboard

## Solution
1. Remove CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET from .env.local
2. Add to Convex Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
3. Restart Convex dev server

## Time Saved Next Time
Original debugging: 3 hours
With this lesson: 5 minutes
```

### Best Practices for Maximum Learning

**1. Run `/advise` before every non-trivial task**
- Search lessons for similar past work
- Read relevant SKILL.md files
- Start with proven approaches

**2. Run `/retrospective` after completing work**
- Especially after solving difficult problems
- Always after trying multiple approaches
- Document exact parameters that worked

**3. Be specific in lessons**
- Include exact error messages encountered
- Document specific version numbers
- Provide copy-paste ready code examples
- No vague advice - only concrete specifics

**4. Share lessons with your team**
- Lessons are stored in git
- PRs document decision-making process
- Team members review and learn from each other
- Collective knowledge compounds faster

### Integration with Security Skills

The continual learning system complements the built-in security skills:

**Security Skills** (`.claude/skills/security/`):
- Pre-built best practices and patterns
- General security implementation guides
- Updated by package maintainers

**Your Lessons** (`.claude/skills/lessons/`):
- YOUR specific experiences applying those patterns
- YOUR project's unique challenges and solutions
- YOUR team's specific parameters and configurations
- Updated by YOU as you work

Together, they create a complete knowledge system:
- Start with security best practices
- Learn from your specific implementations
- Build institutional knowledge over time
- Never repeat the same mistake twice

### Getting Started with Continual Learning

**Day 1**: Just use the system normally
- Complete your tasks as you normally would
- Run `/retrospective` at end of day to capture learnings

**Day 7**: Start seeing benefits
- Run `/advise` before starting similar tasks
- Notice faster completion times on repeated work

**Day 30**: System is significantly smarter
- Substantial lessons library built up
- Most tasks have relevant past experience
- Development velocity noticeably increased

**Day 90**: Institutional knowledge established
- Comprehensive coverage of common tasks
- New team members leverage your experience
- Complex tasks completed in fraction of original time

---

**Remember**: Every session you complete makes the NEXT session faster. The system literally gets smarter the more you use it. 🚀

## Security Configuration

### CSRF Protection

This application includes built-in CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for all state-changing operations. To enable CSRF protection, you need to configure two secret keys:

1. **Generate CSRF secrets:**

```bash
# Generate CSRF_SECRET
node -p "require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url')"

# Generate SESSION_SECRET
node -p "require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url')"
```

2. **Add to `.env.local`:**

```bash
CSRF_SECRET=your_generated_csrf_secret_here
SESSION_SECRET=your_generated_session_secret_here
```

### How CSRF Protection Works

- CSRF tokens are automatically generated and bound to user sessions using HMAC-SHA256
- Tokens are stored in HTTP-only, SameSite=Strict cookies (`XSRF-TOKEN`)
- Frontend applications should fetch tokens from `/api/csrf` before making POST requests
- Tokens are single-use and cleared after validation

### Using CSRF Protection in Your API Routes

To protect an API route with CSRF validation:

```typescript
import { withCsrf } from '@/lib/withCsrf';
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

async function myProtectedHandler(request: NextRequest) {
  // Your API logic here
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}

// Wrap your handler with withCsrf
export const POST = withCsrf(myProtectedHandler);
```

### Frontend Usage

```typescript
// Fetch CSRF token
const response = await fetch('/api/csrf', { credentials: 'include' });
const { csrfToken } = await response.json();

// Use token in POST request
await fetch('/api/your-endpoint', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'X-CSRF-Token': csrfToken
  },
  credentials: 'include',
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
});
```

### Rate Limiting

The application includes built-in rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks and abuse. Rate limiting is configured per IP address:

- **Limit**: 5 requests per minute per IP address
- **Response**: HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) when limit exceeded

#### Using Rate Limiting in Your API Routes

To protect an API route with rate limiting:

```typescript
import { withRateLimit } from '@/lib/withRateLimit';
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

async function sensitiveHandler(request: NextRequest) {
  // Your API logic here
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}

// Wrap your handler with withRateLimit
export const POST = withRateLimit(sensitiveHandler);
```

#### Combining Rate Limiting with CSRF Protection

For maximum security, you can combine both protections:

```typescript
import { withRateLimit } from '@/lib/withRateLimit';
import { withCsrf } from '@/lib/withCsrf';
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';

async function protectedHandler(request: NextRequest) {
  // Your API logic here
  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}

// Apply both rate limiting and CSRF protection
export const POST = withRateLimit(withCsrf(protectedHandler));
```

**Note**: Rate limiting tracks by IP address using the `x-forwarded-for` header (for proxies/load balancers) or `x-real-ip` as fallback.

#### Testing Rate Limiting

A test script is provided to verify rate limiting is working correctly on your protected endpoints:

```bash
# Test the default test endpoint (uses port 3000)
node scripts/test-rate-limit.js

# Specify a custom port if your dev server runs on a different port
node scripts/test-rate-limit.js --port=3003

# Test your custom protected endpoint
node scripts/test-rate-limit.js /api/your-custom-route
```

**Expected Results:**
- First 5 requests: HTTP 200 (Success)
- Requests 6-10: HTTP 429 (Rate Limited)

The script will display color-coded results showing which requests succeeded and which were rate limited. Wait 60 seconds between test runs for the rate limit to reset.

### Input Validation & XSS Prevention

The application uses Zod schemas for type-safe input validation and XSS prevention. All user input is validated and sanitized before processing.

#### XSS Sanitization

User input is automatically sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by removing dangerous characters:

- **Removed**: `<` `>` `"` `&`
- **Preserved**: `'` (apostrophes for names like O'Neal, D'Angelo, etc.)

**Note**: React automatically escapes JSX output, so this is defense-in-depth protection.

#### Using Validation Schemas

Import pre-built schemas from `@/lib/validation`:

```typescript
import {
  emailSchema,
  safeTextSchema,
  safeLongTextSchema,
  createPostSchema
} from '@/lib/validation';
```

#### Example: Validated API Route

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { withRateLimit } from '@/lib/withRateLimit';
import { withCsrf } from '@/lib/withCsrf';
import { validateRequest } from '@/lib/validateRequest';
import { createPostSchema } from '@/lib/validation';

async function createPostHandler(request: NextRequest) {
  const body = await request.json();

  // Validate and sanitize input
  const validation = validateRequest(createPostSchema, body);

  if (!validation.success) {
    return validation.response; // Returns 400 with error details
  }

  // validation.data is type-safe and XSS-sanitized
  const { title, content, tags } = validation.data;

  // Save to database (data is already sanitized)
  // ...

  return NextResponse.json({ success: true });
}

// Apply all security layers
export const POST = withRateLimit(withCsrf(createPostHandler));
```

#### Available Schemas

- **`emailSchema`** - Email validation with sanitization
- **`safeTextSchema`** - Short text (max 100 chars)
- **`safeLongTextSchema`** - Long text (max 5000 chars)
- **`usernameSchema`** - Alphanumeric usernames
- **`urlSchema`** - HTTPS URLs only
- **`contactFormSchema`** - Complete contact form
- **`createPostSchema`** - User-generated content
- **`updateProfileSchema`** - Profile updates

See `lib/validation.ts` for all available schemas and create custom ones as needed.

#### Example: Convex Mutation with Validation

```typescript
// convex/posts.ts
import { mutation } from "./_generated/server";
import { createPostSchema } from "../lib/validation";

export const createPost = mutation({
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const validation = createPostSchema.safeParse(args);

    if (!validation.success) {
      throw new Error("Invalid input");
    }

    // validation.data is sanitized
    await ctx.db.insert("posts", validation.data);
  }
});
```

### Additional Security Headers

The application automatically sets the following security headers on all responses:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Controls resource loading
- `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow` - Prevents indexing of protected routes
- `Strict-Transport-Security` - Forces HTTPS in production (HSTS)

### Secure Error Handling

The application includes secure error handling to prevent information leakage:

- **Development**: Full error details and stack traces for debugging
- **Production**: Generic error messages, no internal details exposed

#### Using Error Handlers

Import error handlers from `@/lib/errorHandler`:

```typescript
import {
  handleApiError,
  handleValidationError,
  handleForbiddenError,
  handleUnauthorizedError,
  handleNotFoundError
} from '@/lib/errorHandler';

async function myApiHandler(request: NextRequest) {
  try {
    // Your API logic here
    const result = await performOperation();
    return NextResponse.json({ success: true, result });
  } catch (error) {
    // Secure error handling (hides stack traces in production)
    return handleApiError(error, 'my-api-route');
  }
}
```

**Available Error Handlers:**
- `handleApiError(error, context)` - HTTP 500 for unexpected errors
- `handleValidationError(message, details)` - HTTP 400 for validation failures
- `handleForbiddenError(message)` - HTTP 403 for authorization failures
- `handleUnauthorizedError(message)` - HTTP 401 for authentication failures
- `handleNotFoundError(resource)` - HTTP 404 for missing resources

### Security Monitoring Dashboard

The application includes a comprehensive real-time security monitoring dashboard accessible at `/dashboard/security`. This feature provides visibility into all security events across your application with advanced filtering and analysis capabilities.

**Admin Only:** The Security Monitoring dashboard is only accessible to the admin user (configured via `ADMIN_EMAIL` environment variable in Convex dashboard). Admin users see an "Administration" section in the sidebar containing the Security Monitoring link. Non-admin users will not see this section and will receive an "Access Denied" message if they navigate directly to `/dashboard/security`.

#### Key Features

- **Real-time Event Tracking** - Monitor security events as they happen
- **Severity Classification** - Events categorized as Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Event Type Filtering** - Filter by specific attack types (rate limiting, CSRF, XSS, prompt injection, etc.)
- **Date Range Selection** - View events from last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or custom ranges
- **Status Management** - Track open (unread) vs closed (read) events
- **Detailed Event Metadata** - View origin, IP address, fingerprint, endpoint, and error details
- **Attack Detection** - Automatic detection of 19+ attack types including:
  - Origin mismatch
  - Rate limit exceeded
  - CSRF validation failed
  - XSS attempts
  - Prompt injection attempts
  - JWT validation failures
  - Fingerprint manipulation
  - Unauthorized access
  - And more...

#### Accessing the Dashboard

1. Ensure `ADMIN_EMAIL` is set in your Convex dashboard environment variables
2. Sign in with the email address matching `ADMIN_EMAIL`
3. Navigate to the "Security Monitoring" link in the "Administration" section of the sidebar

#### Logging Security Events

Security events are automatically logged when using the built-in security middlewares (`withRateLimit`, `withCsrf`, etc.). You can also manually log events using the security logger:

```typescript
import { logSecurity } from '@/convex/lib/securityLogger';

// In a Convex mutation
await logSecurity(
  ctx,
  projectId,
  "xss_attempt",
  "high",
  {
    endpoint: "/api/submit",
    ipAddress: request.headers.get('x-forwarded-for'),
    errorMessage: "XSS pattern detected in user input",
    requestPayload: JSON.stringify(body)
  }
);
```

#### Testing Security Events

Security events are automatically logged when violations occur in the real middleware. The easiest way to test is to trigger actual rate limit violations.

**Testing Rate Limiting (Recommended):**

```bash
# Start the dev server first
npm run dev

# Run the rate limit test script
node scripts/test-rate-limit.js

# Specify a custom port (default is 3000)
node scripts/test-rate-limit.js --port=3001
```

**What happens:**
1. The script sends 10 rapid requests to `/api/test-rate-limit`
2. First 5 requests succeed (HTTP 200)
3. Remaining 5 requests are rate-limited (HTTP 429)
4. Each rate limit violation is logged to the security dashboard
5. Events appear in `/dashboard/security` with type `rate_limit_exceeded`

**Viewing Security Events:**
1. Sign in to the application
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/security`
3. View logged rate limit violations and other security events
4. Filter by severity, event type, or date range

**Note:** Events are logged automatically by the middleware - no manual logging required.

#### Event Types

The dashboard tracks the following security event types:

- `origin_mismatch` - Request from unauthorized origin
- `rate_limit_exceeded` - Too many requests from single IP
- `invalid_api_key` - Invalid API key provided
- `fingerprint_change` - Browser fingerprint changed mid-session
- `suspicious_activity` - Anomaly detection triggered
- `jwt_validation_failed` - JWT token validation error
- `unauthorized_access` - Access to protected resource without auth
- `input_validation_failed` - Input validation rejected malicious data
- `replay_detected` - Replay attack detected
- `csrf_validation_failed` - CSRF token validation failed
- `xss_attempt` - Cross-site scripting attempt detected
- `prompt_injection_attempt` - AI prompt injection detected
- `fingerprint_manipulation` - Browser fingerprint tampering
- `http_origin_blocked` - Blocked origin in HTTP request
- And more...

#### Dashboard Views

**Summary Cards:**
- Total Events - Overview of all security events
- Critical Events - Immediate action required
- High Events - Authentication failures
- Medium Events - Rate limiting violations
- Low Events - Informational events
- Overall Status - Current security posture

**Event Feed:**
- Chronological list of security events
- Expandable details for each event
- Request payload viewing
- Mark as read/unread functionality
- End-user information when available

### Security Auditing

#### Running Security Checks

Use the provided script to audit dependencies and check for vulnerabilities:

```bash
# Run comprehensive security check
bash scripts/security-check.sh

# Or manually:
npm audit --production
npm outdated
```

#### Fixing Vulnerabilities

```bash
# Automatic fixes (minor/patch updates)
npm audit fix

# Force major version updates (review breaking changes!)
npm audit fix --force
```

**Recommendation**: Run `npm audit` regularly and before deploying to production.

## Architecture

## Security Skills

Security architecture is implemented through specialized Claude Code skills managed as a separate package:

- **Package**: [secure-claude-skills](https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills)
- **npm**: `npx secure-claude-skills init`
- **Location**: `.claude/skills/security/` (managed as git subtree)

The skills are synchronized with the main package using git subtree. To update:

\`\`\`bash
git subtree pull --prefix=.claude/skills/security \\
  https://github.com/harperaa/secure-claude-skills.git main --squash
\`\`\`
```

## 🔄 Keeping Your OS Updated

Secure Vibe Coding OS is a **living template** that receives regular updates including:
- 🛡️ New security features and hardening improvements
- 📚 Additional course modules and learning materials
- 🔧 Enhanced Claude Code commands and agents
- 🐛 Bug fixes and dependency updates
- ⚡ Performance optimizations

### Update Commands Overview

The template includes specialized pull commands to help you selectively update different parts of your installation:

| Command | Updates | Safety Level | Use When |
|---------|---------|--------------|----------|
| `/pull-repo-safe` | Entire repository | ✅ Safe (preview first) | General updates to core template |
| `/pull-security-skills` | Security skills only | ✅ Safe (merge with squash) | Security feature updates |
| `/pull-commands` | Claude commands only | ⚠️ Force overwrites | Command updates only |
| `/pull-agents` | Claude agents only | ⚠️ Force overwrites | Agent updates only |

### How to Update

#### Option 1: Safe Full Update (Recommended)

Use this when you've customized your app and want to safely merge template updates:

```bash
# From your project root, use the Claude Code command:
/pull-repo-safe
```

**What happens:**
1. Fetches latest changes from the main repository
2. Shows you exactly what changed (file-by-file diff)
3. Detects if you have uncommitted local changes
4. Provides step-by-step merge instructions
5. Lets you decide what to merge

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# Step 1: Check for updates
/pull-repo-safe

# Step 2: Review the changes shown
# Read the diffs carefully

# Step 3: Commit your local changes
git add . && git commit -m 'Save my customizations'

# Step 4: Merge the updates
git merge origin/main

# Step 5: Resolve any conflicts (if they occur)
# - Edit conflicted files
# - git add <resolved-files>
# - git commit -m 'Merge template updates'
```

💡 **Let Claude Code help you merge:**
```
Ask Claude: "Commit my current changes, then merge the updates from origin/main,
resolving any conflicts while preserving my customizations"
```

#### Option 2: Update Security Skills Only

Security skills are updated frequently with new security patterns and best practices:

```bash
/pull-security-skills
```

**What happens:**
1. Checks for local changes in `.claude/skills/security/`
2. Shows you what you've modified (if anything)
3. Pulls latest security skills using git subtree
4. Merges changes with `--squash` flag (keeps history clean)

**If conflicts occur:**
```bash
# Manual resolution:
git status                                    # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .                                     # Stage resolved files
git commit -m 'Merge security skills updates' # Complete the merge

# Or ask Claude Code:
"Review the merge conflicts and resolve them intelligently,
preserving my customizations while integrating new features"
```

#### Option 3: Update Commands Only

Use this to get the latest Claude Code commands without touching your app code:

```bash
/pull-commands
```

**⚠️ Warning:** This will overwrite any local changes in `.claude/commands/`

**What happens:**
1. Checks for uncommitted changes in `.claude/commands/`
2. Shows you what you've modified
3. Warns that continuing will overwrite your changes
4. Gives you a chance to cancel (Ctrl+C)
5. Force pulls latest commands from origin/main

**After successful update:**
```bash
git commit -m "Update Claude Code commands from template"

# Or ask Claude Code:
"Review the updated commands and commit them with a descriptive message"
```

#### Option 4: Update Agents Only

Get the latest Claude Code agents without touching anything else:

```bash
/pull-agents
```

**⚠️ Warning:** This will overwrite any local changes in `.claude/agents/`

**What happens:**
Same as `/pull-commands` but for the `.claude/agents/` folder.

### Best Practices for Updating

#### 1. **Commit Before Updating**
Always commit your work before pulling updates:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Save my current work before updating"
```

#### 2. **Use Safe Updates for Customized Code**
If you've modified app pages, components, or core functionality:
- ✅ Use `/pull-repo-safe` to preview changes
- ❌ Don't use force update commands

#### 3. **Review Changes Before Merging**
Take time to read the diffs shown by `/pull-repo-safe`:
- Understand what's changing
- Identify potential conflicts with your customizations
- Decide what to merge and what to skip

#### 4. **Update Frequently**
- Check for updates weekly or monthly
- Smaller, frequent updates are easier to merge than large infrequent ones
- Security updates should be applied promptly

#### 5. **Test After Updates**
After merging updates:
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies (if package.json changed)
npm install

# Run type checking
npm run tsc --noEmit

# Test your app locally
npm run dev

# Visit key pages and test functionality
```

#### 6. **Use Version Tags**
Instead of always pulling from `main`, you can pull specific releases:
```bash
git fetch --tags
git merge v2.0.0  # Merge a specific version
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts

When conflicts occur, you have options:

#### Manual Resolution
```bash
# 1. See conflicted files
git status

# 2. Open each file and look for conflict markers:
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your customizations
=======
Template updates
>>>>>>> origin/main

# 3. Edit to keep what you want
# 4. Remove conflict markers
# 5. Save the file
# 6. Stage resolved files
git add <resolved-file>

# 7. Complete the merge
git commit -m "Merge template updates"
```

#### Claude Code Assisted Resolution

Ask Claude Code to help:
```
"Review the merge conflicts and resolve them intelligently,
preserving my customizations while integrating new features"
```

Or:
```
"Help me merge the security skills updates"
```

Claude Code can:
- Analyze both versions
- Understand intent
- Preserve your customizations
- Integrate new features
- Resolve conflicts intelligently

### What Gets Updated

#### Core Files (Use `/pull-repo-safe`)
- `app/` - Application pages and routes
- `components/` - UI components
- `lib/` - Utility libraries
- `convex/` - Backend functions and schema
- `package.json` - Dependencies

#### Security Skills (Use `/pull-security-skills`)
- `.claude/skills/security/` - All security implementation guides
- New security patterns and best practices
- Updated vulnerability awareness content

#### Commands (Use `/pull-commands`)
- `.claude/commands/` - Claude Code command definitions
- Automation scripts and workflows

#### Agents (Use `/pull-agents`)
- `.claude/agents/` - Specialized Claude Code agents
- Task automation configurations

### Selective Updates Strategy

You don't have to update everything:

**Conservative approach:**
```bash
# Only update what you need
/pull-security-skills  # Get security updates (important!)
/pull-commands         # Get new commands (optional)
# Skip core template updates if you've heavily customized
```

**Aggressive approach:**
```bash
# Stay current with everything
/pull-repo-safe        # Review and merge all updates
# Follow prompts to merge
```

**Smart approach:**
```bash
# Update frequently used parts, cherry-pick core updates
/pull-security-skills  # Security is critical
/pull-commands         # Commands are easy to update
/pull-agents           # Agents enhance productivity

# For core template:
/pull-repo-safe        # Preview changes
# Cherry-pick specific features you want:
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

## Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with Turbopack
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run generate:sitemap` - Generate sitemap.xml and robots.txt

## Blog

The starter kit includes a full-featured, SEO and LLM-optimized blog engine built for maximum discoverability by both search engines and AI crawlers like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity.

### Blog Content Location

Blog posts are stored as Markdown/MDX files in:

```
/content/blog/
├── your-first-post.mdx
├── another-post.mdx
└── ...
```

### Creating a Blog Post with `/create-blog` (Recommended)

The easiest way to create a blog post is with the `/create-blog` Claude Code command:

```bash
claude
# Then type: /create-blog "How to implement rate limiting in Next.js"
```

This command:
1. **Gathers requirements** — asks for topic, audience, category, and key points
2. **Generates SEO-optimized content** — full MDX article with proper heading hierarchy, summary section, and LLM-friendly structure
3. **Creates an AI banner image** — generates a 16:9 banner using Gemini Pro via `scripts/generate-image.js` and saves it to `public/blog/images/`
4. **Saves everything** — writes the MDX file to `content/blog/` with complete frontmatter and the image in the correct location

The banner image is generated automatically using the Gemini Pro API. You'll need a `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your `.env.local` — get one free at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys). This same key is also used by the `/technical-diagram` command to generate Nano Banana Pro architecture diagrams.

You can also generate images independently:

```bash
node scripts/generate-image.js "Your prompt here" "public/blog/images/output.png" --aspect-ratio 16:9
```

### Creating a Blog Post Manually

Create a new `.mdx` file in `/content/blog/` with the following frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "A clear, concise description for SEO (150-160 characters)"
date: "2026-01-08"
author: "Your Name"
category: "Security"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"]
image: "/blog/images/your-image.png"
---

## Summary

A 2-3 sentence summary of your article. LLMs extract this first, so make it count.

## Your Content Here

Write your content using standard Markdown syntax...
```

### Blog Features

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - All posts pre-rendered at build time for fast loading
- **Full-text Search** - Client-side search across all posts
- **Categories & Tags** - Filter posts by category or tag
- **Table of Contents** - Auto-generated from headings with scroll tracking
- **Related Posts** - Automatically suggests related articles
- **Reading Time** - Estimated reading time for each post
- **Social Sharing** - Twitter, LinkedIn, and copy link buttons
- **RSS Feed** - Available at `/feed.xml`
- **Dark Mode** - Full dark mode support with prose styling

### LLM SEO Optimization

The blog is optimized for AI crawlers with:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/public/llms.txt` | Guides AI crawlers to your most important content |
| `/public/sitemap.xml` | Auto-generated sitemap with all blog URLs |
| `/public/robots.txt` | Explicitly allows GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot |
| `/feed.xml` | RSS feed for content syndication |

**Key optimizations:**
- Server-side rendered content (AI crawlers don't execute JavaScript)
- JSON-LD structured data (TechArticle schema) on every post
- Clear heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Summary sections for easy LLM extraction
- Consistent terminology for strong embeddings

### Generating the Sitemap

The sitemap is automatically generated before each build via the `prebuild` script. You can also generate it manually:

```bash
npm run generate:sitemap
```

This creates:
- `/public/sitemap.xml` - All blog posts, categories, and tags
- `/public/robots.txt` - AI crawler permissions (if not exists)

### Adding Blog Images

Blog images are stored in `/public/blog/images/` and referenced in frontmatter:

```yaml
image: "/blog/images/my-post-image.png"
```

The `/create-blog` command generates banner images automatically. To generate one manually:

```bash
node scripts/generate-image.js "Professional blog header about your topic, modern tech style, no text" "public/blog/images/your-slug.png" --aspect-ratio 16:9
```

Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`. Get your key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys), then add to `.env.local`:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Environment Variables for Blog

Set your site URL for proper sitemap and meta tag generation:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Production Deployment

> **📘 For the recommended deployment path (`/install` → `/deploy-to-dev` → `/deploy-to-prod`) and advanced deployment topics, see [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md)**

The sections below cover manual production setup for reference. If you have Claude Code, the `/deploy-to-prod` command automates most of these steps.

### Understanding Development vs Production Instances

This application uses **separate instances** for development and production. Both can run simultaneously without interfering with each other.

#### Instance Separation

**Clerk:** Has separate Development and Production instances
```
Your Application in Clerk Dashboard
  ├─ Development Instance
  │  ├─ Keys: pk_test_..., sk_test_...
  │  ├─ Users: Test users
  │  └─ Stripe: Test mode
  │
  └─ Production Instance
     ├─ Keys: pk_live_..., sk_live_...
     ├─ Users: Real users
     └─ Stripe: Live mode
```

**Convex:** Has separate Development and Production deployments
```
Your Project in Convex Dashboard
  ├─ dev:your-deployment-name
  │  ├─ URL: https://....convex.cloud
  │  └─ Database: Dev data
  │
  └─ prod:your-deployment-name
     ├─ URL: https://....convex.site
     └─ Database: Prod data
```

#### How Instances Are Selected

**Your application connects to different instances based on environment variables:**

**Local Development (.env.local):**
```bash
# Points to DEV instances
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=dev:polite-bulldog-532
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://....convex.cloud
```

**Production (Vercel Environment Variables):**
```bash
# Points to PROD instances
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=prod:your-deployment-name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://....convex.site
```

### Setting Up Production (Step-by-Step Walkthrough)

> **Tip:** If you have [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code), the `/deploy-to-prod` command automates most of these steps. See [Quick Deploy to Production](#quick-deploy-to-production-recommended) above.

Follow this complete guide to deploy your application to production with Clerk, Convex, and Vercel.

---

#### Part 1: Create Clerk Production Instance

**Step 1: Create Production Instance**

1. Go to **Clerk Dashboard:** https://dashboard.clerk.com
2. **Select your application** (the one you created for development)
3. **Top of page:** Click the **"Development"** toggle/dropdown (top right corner)
4. **Click:** "Create production instance"
5. **Choose:**
   - **"Clone development settings"** (recommended - copies your dev config), OR
   - **"Use default settings"** (start fresh)
6. **Application domain:** Enter your custom domain (e.g., `myapp.com` or `app.mydomain.com`). Clerk requires a domain you own — `*.vercel.app` is not accepted. You can update this later in Clerk Dashboard → Domains.
7. **Click:** "Create Instance"

Clerk creates a separate production instance alongside your dev instance (dev instance is NOT removed).

**Step 2: Get Production API Keys**

1. **Ensure you're viewing Production** (top toggle should say "Production")
2. **Left sidebar:** Click **"API Keys"**
3. **Copy and save these keys:**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (starts with `pk_live_...`)
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` (starts with `sk_live_...`)
   - Frontend API URL (e.g., `https://your-prod.clerk.accounts.dev`)

You'll add these to Vercel later.

**Step 3: Configure Production Domain**

1. **Left sidebar:** Click **"Domains"**
2. **Add your production domain:**
   - For Vercel: `your-app.vercel.app` (DNS automatic)
   - For custom domain: Add domain and configure DNS records shown
3. **Wait for DNS propagation** (if custom domain - can take up to 48 hours)

**Step 4: Configure OAuth Providers (If Using Social Login)**

1. **Left sidebar:** Click **"SSO Connections"** or **"Social Connections"**
2. **For each provider you use** (Google, GitHub, etc.):
   - Click the provider
   - **Important:** Production requires YOUR OWN OAuth credentials
   - Click "Use custom credentials"
   - Follow Clerk's provider-specific guide to create OAuth app
   - Add Client ID and Client Secret from the provider
   - Save

**Note:** Development uses Clerk's shared credentials, but production requires your own for security.

**Step 5: Connect Stripe**

1. **Left sidebar:** Click **"Billing"** → **"Settings"**
2. **Click:** "Connect Stripe Account"
3. **Choose:**
   - Connect existing Stripe account (if you have one), OR
   - Create new Stripe account through Clerk
4. **Follow Stripe connection flow**
5. **Important:** Start in **Stripe Test Mode** (toggle at top of Billing page)

**Step 6: Deploy Certificates**

1. **Go to Clerk Dashboard home page**
2. **Review checklist** - it shows remaining steps
3. **Once all green checkmarks appear:**
   - Click **"Deploy certificates"** button
   - This activates your production instance

**✅ Clerk Production Instance is now active!**

---

#### Part 2: Create Convex Production Deployment

**Step 1: Generate Production Deploy Key**

1. **Go to Convex Dashboard:** https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. **Select your project**
3. **Left sidebar:** Click **"Settings"** → **"Deploy Keys"**
4. **Click:** "Generate a production deploy key"
5. **Copy the entire key** (format: `prod:xxx|yyy...`)
6. **Save it securely** - you'll add this to Vercel

**Important:** This key is shown only once. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.

**Step 2: Note Your Convex Project Info**

You'll need:
- Production deployment name (will be `prod:your-deployment-name`)
- Production URL (will be created on first deploy, ends with `.convex.site`)

These will be auto-configured by Vercel during deployment.

---

#### Part 3: Configure Vercel for Production

**Step 1: Create Vercel Project**

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com
2. **Click:** "Add New Project"
3. **Import your GitHub repository:** `harperaa/secure-vibe-coding-OS`
4. **Click:** "Import"

**Step 2: Configure Build Settings**

**In Vercel project configuration (before first deploy):**

1. **Build Command** - Override to:
   ```bash
   npx convex deploy --cmd 'npm run build'
   ```

2. **Install Command** - Leave as default:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Output Directory** - Leave as default:
   ```
   .next
   ```

4. **Root Directory** - Leave as default (blank)

**Step 3: Add Production Environment Variables**

**In Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables:**

**For each variable below, select "Production" environment:**

```bash
# Convex Production Deploy Key (CRITICAL - from Part 2, Step 1)
CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY=prod:abc123|xyz...

# Clerk Production Keys (from Part 1, Step 2)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=https://your-prod.clerk.accounts.dev

# Site Branding
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=Secure Vibe Coding OS

# CSRF Protection (use SAME values from your .env.local)
CSRF_SECRET=<copy-from-your-dev-env>
SESSION_SECRET=<copy-from-your-dev-env>

# Clerk Redirects (same as dev)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FORCE_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_FALLBACK_REDIRECT_URL=/dashboard
```

**Important:**
- Do NOT add `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` manually
- Convex automatically sets these during the deploy process
- Only add `CONVEX_DEPLOY_KEY` - the rest is automatic

**Step 4: Deploy to Production**

1. **Click:** "Deploy" button
2. **Watch the deployment logs:**
   - Convex will deploy your functions
   - Create production deployment (if first time)
   - Build your Next.js app
   - Deploy to Vercel

3. **After successful deploy:**
   - Note your production URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
   - Visit the URL to verify it's working

4. **Go to Convex Dashboard:**
   - You'll now see a **`prod:your-deployment-name`** deployment
   - Click it and copy the production URL (ends with `.convex.site`)
   - You'll need this for webhooks in the next part

#### Part 4: Configure Production Webhooks

**Step 1: Set Up Clerk Production Webhook**

1. **Clerk Dashboard** → Ensure in **Production** mode (top toggle)
2. **Left sidebar:** Click **"Webhooks"**
3. **Click:** "Add Endpoint"
4. **Endpoint URL** - Enter your Convex production URL + endpoint:
   ```
   https://your-prod-deployment.convex.site/clerk-users-webhook
   ```
5. **Subscribe to events** - Check these:
   - ✅ `user.created`
   - ✅ `user.updated`
   - ✅ `user.deleted`
   - ✅ `paymentAttempt.updated`
6. **Click:** "Create"
7. **Copy the signing secret** (starts with `whsec_...`)

**Step 2: Add Webhook Secret to Convex Production**

1. **Convex Dashboard** → Select your **production deployment** (prod:...)
2. **Left sidebar:** Click **"Settings"** → **"Environment Variables"**
3. **Add these variables:**
   ```bash
   CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_production_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=https://your-prod.clerk.accounts.dev
   ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email@example.com
   ```
4. **Click:** "Save"

**Step 3: Verify Webhook Connection**

1. Create a test user in your production app
2. Check Convex Dashboard → Production → Data → `users` table
3. User should appear (confirms webhook working)

---

#### Part 5: Test Production (Before Going Live)

**Phase 1: Test Mode Testing**

1. **Verify Stripe is in Test Mode:**
   - Clerk Dashboard (Production) → Billing → Settings
   - Should show "Test Mode" toggle enabled

2. **Visit your production URL:** `https://your-app.vercel.app`

3. **Test user signup/login:**
   - Create account
   - Sign in
   - Verify user appears in Convex production database

4. **Test subscription with Stripe test card:**
   - Go to payment-gated page
   - Click subscribe
   - Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Any future date, any CVC
   - Complete "payment"

5. **Verify subscription access:**
   - Should redirect to payment-gated content
   - Check Convex → `paymentAttempts` table
   - Subscription should be recorded

6. **Test subscription cancellation:**
   - User profile → Manage subscription
   - Cancel subscription
   - Verify access revoked

**Phase 2: Go Live with Real Payments**

**When everything works in test mode:**

1. **Clerk Dashboard** (Production) → **Billing** → **Settings**
2. **Toggle:** Switch from **Test Mode** to **Live Mode**
3. **Confirm** the switch (Clerk will warn you about real payments)
4. **Test with real card:**
   - Subscribe yourself with a real credit card
   - Verify charge appears in your Stripe dashboard
   - Verify subscription works
   - Cancel subscription (to avoid recurring charges)

5. **You're now live!** 🚀
   - Real users can sign up
   - Real payments are processed
   - Stripe takes their fees (~2.9% + 30¢)

---

#### Part 6: Ongoing Production Management

**Monitoring:**
- Clerk Dashboard (Production) → View real users
- Convex Dashboard (Production) → Monitor database
- Stripe Dashboard → Track payments and revenue
- Vercel Dashboard → Monitor deployments and performance

**Updates:**
- Make changes locally (uses dev instances)
- Test thoroughly in development
- Push to GitHub
- Vercel auto-deploys to production
- Both dev and prod run simultaneously

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Production is separate from development
- ✅ Making production doesn't delete development
- ✅ You can develop locally while users use production
- ✅ Each environment is completely isolated

### Development Workflow With Both Instances

**Typical developer workflow:**

**Morning - Start developing:**
```bash
npm run dev          # Terminal 1 - Next.js dev server
npx convex dev       # Terminal 2 - Convex dev connection
```
→ Uses dev instances, test users, test payments

**Meanwhile:**
- Production app running on Vercel
- Real users using production instances
- Completely isolated from your dev work

**Deploy changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "New feature"
git push origin main
```
→ Vercel auto-deploys to production
→ Production uses prod instances
→ Dev instances unchanged

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Dev and prod instances never interfere
- ✅ Dev instances exist permanently (not removed when creating prod)
- ✅ Same codebase, different environment variables select which instance
- ✅ You can develop locally while prod serves real users
- ✅ Each instance has separate users, databases, and payment data

### Environment Variables Summary

**Variables that CHANGE between dev and prod:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (pk_test_ → pk_live_)
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` (sk_test_ → sk_live_)
- `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` (dev:... → prod:...)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` (.convex.cloud → .convex.site)

**Variables that STAY THE SAME:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME`
- `CSRF_SECRET`
- `SESSION_SECRET`
- All `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_*` redirect URLs
